# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Introduction
- Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major global health concern, responsible for a significant percentage of worldwide deaths.
- The economic burden of CVDs is substantial, leading to delayed detection and significant human and financial costs.
- Leveraging data mining and machine learning methods for early detection of heart disease is crucial.

## Problem Statement
- The challenge is to efficiently and timely detect heart disease given its impact on morbidity and mortality.
- Current diagnostic technologies are often expensive and impractical, resulting in preventable deaths and high medical expenses.
- The goal is to predict the likelihood of developing heart disease using machine learning algorithms for more accurate predictions and improved generalizability.

## Methodology
- The project aimed to predict the probability of heart disease through various algorithms beneficial for medical professionals and patients.
- Data mining techniques were utilized to reveal hidden patterns for clinical diagnosis.
- Different machine learning algorithms were applied to a diverse dataset to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Training Procedure
- Models were trained on the training set using hyperparameters identified through Grid Search CV.
- The training process involved iteratively adjusting model parameters to maximize recall, a critical evaluation metric for heart disease prediction.

## Experimental Results and Discussion
- The model with the highest recall score was selected as the best-performing model for heart disease prediction.
- Recall was prioritized due to the critical nature of correctly identifying instances of heart disease.

## Team Contribution
- Each team member played a significant role in developing a robust machine learning model for heart disease prediction.
- Contributions included data preprocessing, data visualization, literature survey, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

## Conclusion
- The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting heart disease.
- By leveraging data mining techniques and diverse datasets, the project aimed to improve early detection and reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases.
